When you were young, you thought Sint Nicolaas and Christmas were the best parts of the year,
well after you've entered Haunted Holidays this time will be over.

    Inside Haunted Holidays...
    </u>
  </b>
</br>
The queue for this Haunted House was super long, about 45 minutes. Inside Haunted Holidays,
happy Christmas music will be playing, but of course it has a twist. You have been a naughty child...
Sint Nicolaas and Santa Claus have teamed up to hunt you down. The helpers of Santa?
Those sweet elves will scare you to death...

    My opinion

</br>
My view of Christmas has changed completely after visiting Haunted Holidays,
I loved the costumes of the characters and how they played their role. This one is really recommended.
