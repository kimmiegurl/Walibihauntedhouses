Jefferson Manor is a big, abandoned manor.
A long time ago the Jefferson family died under suspicious circumstances.
Rumor has it, the Jefferson family conjured spirits.
Are these rumors true and is this what killed the Jefferson family...?

   Inside Jefferson Manor...
  </u>

  </br>
Last year, Eddie's Funhouse of Fear was found at this place.
The queues are about one and a half hour and you have to wait outside in the cold.
When you walk inside Jefferson Manor, people will be waiting for you.
There the people come out of the paintings, they stand behind the doors,
they sit inside of bookshelves and believe me, they <b> will </b> scare you.
The scariest part was the person inside of the mirror, she had white hair,
pale skin, yellow teeth and she follows every move you make.

    My opinion
    </u>
  </b>
</br>
I thought Jefferson Manor had amazing special effects. The people were really into their role
and did a great job in scaring people.
