   Inside Psychoshock...
   </u>
 </b>
</br>
You only have to wait about 15 minutes to enter this asylum. Once inside, there are scary dentists,
doctors and prisoners waiting for you. It smells like death and dentist. You hear the dental drill and
the person screaming laying on the chair. The prisoners are trying to get you to join them and
the doctor is laughing disturbingly. Try to make it outside and run as fast as you can...

    My opinion
    </u>
  </b>
</br>
To be honest, I really hated this Haunted House because I hate dentists and doctors,
but I had to laugh half of the time because my friends were screaming so loud. It was a nice Haunted House.
