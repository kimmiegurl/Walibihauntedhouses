Do you dare to book a treatment in this disreputable clinic? Dr. Adams will treat you with
great care and precision. Like every good healt facility, dr. Adams is very strict in his secrecy.
We can tell you one thing though, you will leave The Clinic as a completely different person.
At least, if you ever leave...

    Inside The Clinic...
    </u>
  </b>
</br>
First, you'll be asked to take of your shoes and socks. Then you'll be bound to a stretcher.
You enter an operating room, with white walls full of blood and the only thing you can move is your face.
Something is being poked into your neck, it feels like a needle, a sedative, then they start to operate on you.
Then yo hear your own heartbeat stopping, you are dying. You go into a room and get cleaned up, then go into a cold storage room
where it is freezing. After being kept there for a while, you'll go into a cremation oven. At the end you are in a small space and you hear
sand falling on top of something, a coffin, your coffin. After that you are free to go and are a new person...

    My opinion
    </u>
  </b>
</br>
This was the scariest Haunted House, because your own death was showed, it was a shame there were not a lot of people in costume around you,
but nonetheless it was scary...
