Always wanted to play the leading role in a Hollywood film?
Auditions aren't necessary during Halloween.
Enter The Villa and get into a Hollywood hell...
Are you sure you want to shine as a moviestar??

   Inside The Villa...

This queue isn't as long as the others, you only have to wait for about 30 minutes.
Before you can go inside a female is waiting for you, she just starts looking at you,
without saying a word and finally after a competition of staring she will scare you.
Inside The Villa it looks like a drama film, people screaming bloody murder,
people coming for you, pretending to grab you or throw stuff at you.
Someone going crazy while being tied down on a bed. And when you think you're safe outside of The Villa,
Chucky will be there...

    My opinion

This was one of my favourite Haunted Houses, because the people here were the most unexpected.
