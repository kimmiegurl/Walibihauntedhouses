     The Walibi Fright Nights is an event which takes place once a year, from the 8th of October until the 30th of October.
    It is every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The idea of The Fright Nights is actually to escape and conquer your fears
    and meanwhile you can go into the attractions, haunted houses and have fun.
    There are scarezones, four normal haunted houses and one extreme haunted house, that's called the Clinic.
